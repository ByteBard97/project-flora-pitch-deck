  **Framing:** "Why now? Because three powerful cultural and market waves are converging — and Flora sits right at their intersection."

  **Wave 1 — Eco-Conscious Consumer:**
  • 71% increase in searches for sustainable goods.
  • Sustainable products are growing 2.7x faster than conventional.
  • The yard is the new frontier for climate action.

  **Wave 2 — Native Plant Movement:**
  • Audubon and NWF are mainstreaming it.
  • Movement is "mired in complexity."
  • Users need a tool that simplifies ecological design.

  **Wave 3 — Democratization of Design:**
  • Canva → Graphic Design, Figma → UI/UX.
  • Flora can play the same role for ecological landscape design.

  **Punchline:** "These three forces create perfect timing. Flora is the convergence point."
