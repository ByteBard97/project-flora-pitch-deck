  **Opening:** "The landscape design software ecosystem is broken, and it's broken in two very different ways."

  **Professional Side:** Professionals are stuck with powerful but punishing tools. AutoCAD with Land F/X or Vectorworks Landmark are technically capable — but cost $1,500+/year, require extensive training, treat plants as generic objects, and force small firms into inefficient workarounds.

  **The Franken-stack:** CAD for drafting, Illustrator for presentation, spreadsheets for takeoffs, and external websites for plant research. This workflow drains time and money while increasing the risk of error.

  **Consumer Side:** Consumers and DIY designers rely on apps like iScape or SketchUp. Easy to pick up, but shallow — plants are decorative clip art with no ecological intelligence. Users quickly hit an "aesthetic ceiling."

  **The Deeper Questions:** Tools can visualize a patio or bed, but can't answer: Will this survive in my soil? Will it support pollinators? Will it thrive in this climate? Many hack together designs in PowerPoint or even video games.

  **Core Tension:** Tools are either overly complex and expensive, or overly simplistic and ecologically blind. Between those extremes lies a massive unmet need.
