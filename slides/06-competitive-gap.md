  **Framing:** "Here's the competitive landscape. Look closely: no one is serving the eco-conscious designer."

  **Y-Axis:** From treating plants as generic objects → deep ecological intelligence.
  **X-Axis:** From pro-grade complexity → beginner-friendly accessibility.

  **Quadrants:**
  • Top-left: CAD/BIM like Vectorworks and AutoCAD — too complex, no ecological data.
  • Bottom-right: Consumer apps like iScape and SketchUp — accessible but shallow.
  • Middle-right: Niche databases like Calscape and NativeScape — have the data, but not the design tools.
  • Top-right: Wide open. This is the **white space where Flora sits.**

  **Punchline:** "Every competitor is stuck in their quadrant. Flora owns the convergence point: accessible, design-friendly, but backed by deep ecological intelligence."
