  **Framing:** “Here’s the solution: Flora is more than software — it’s a platform. Intelligent, intuitive, and sustainable.”

  **Vision Statement:** Empower anyone to create landscapes that are beautiful, sustainable, and ecologically functional, with confidence.

  **Three Pillars:**  
  1. Deep native plant database (the data moat).  
  2. Intuitive beginner-friendly design tools (the accessibility moat).  
  3. Community-driven knowledge platform (the network-effect moat).

  **Demo Preview:** Show the mockup — Flora suggests plants intelligently, integrates design + data, and feels effortless to use.
