  **Framing:** “These frustrations aren’t just pain — they’re a market signal.”

  **Market Size:** Global landscape design software market is ~$2.95B in 2024 and forecasted to reach $5.45B by 2030, growing at a healthy 10.8% CAGR.

  **Foundation:** It’s built on top of a massive $264.7B landscaping services industry. This is no niche; it’s a core part of the economy.

  **Adoption:** 93% of landscape businesses already use software — the question is not *if*, but *which* platform they’ll standardize on.

  **Opportunity:** No integrated solution exists. Every competitor is either too complex, too simple, or too fragmented. That leaves a wide-open gap for Flora to lead.
