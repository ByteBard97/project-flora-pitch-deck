  **Framing:** "Flora compresses hours of fragmented work into minutes. Here's the new flow."

  **Step 1 — Automated Site Setup:** Enter address → pull GIS parcel lines, hi-res satellite (Mapbox), and USGS elevation → accurate 3D-ready base in seconds. **Saves 2–3 hrs.**

  **Step 2 — Guided, Intelligent Design:** Simple 2D-first canvas. **Eco-CoPilot** suggests native plants by ecoregion, soil, sun. **Saves 4–6 hrs.**

  **Step 3 — Community Inspiration:** Real photos/templates from your region. Filter by conditions (e.g., "full sun clay slope") and see what worked for neighbors. **Saves 2–4 hrs.**

  **Step 4 — Confident Execution:** One click → pro design doc, curated plant list, phased plan. **Saves 1–2 hrs.**

  **Comparison:** Old way 8–15 hrs across tools → Flora 30–60 mins integrated.
