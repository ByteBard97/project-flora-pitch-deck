  **Framing:** "Why will Flora win? Because we have a three-layer moat: data, UX, and community."

  **1. The Data Asset:**
  Proprietary, relational native plant database. Competitors can't and won't build this depth — too costly and too niche. High barrier to entry.

  **2. The Accessible UX:**
  Not a 'dumbed-down CAD.' Like Canva vs Adobe — it's a fundamentally smarter, better tool for a new job: ecological decision-making. Sustainable differentiation.

  **3. The Community Flywheel:**
  The AllTrails playbook. Every photo, review, or planting shared compounds value for the next user. Nearly impossible to replicate from scratch. Exponential network effects.

  **Punchline:** "Each moat reinforces the others. Together, they're why we'll win."
