  **Framing:** "Let's look at how professionals actually get work done today. It's a mess — a Franken-stack of disconnected tools."

  **Workflow Chaos:** AutoCAD for drafting, Illustrator for visuals, Excel for takeoffs, and even external sites for plant research. Every handoff is manual and error-prone.

  **Hidden Costs:**
  • Data risk: import/export corruption and cleanup.
  • Time sink: manual takeoffs eat hours on razor-thin margins.
  • Financial drain: $3,000+/year across subscriptions.
  • Efficiency loss: countless hours wasted.

  **Transition:** "This is the environment Flora is built to replace — one system instead of four."
