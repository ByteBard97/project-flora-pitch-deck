  **Framing:** “We’ve validated the research, the market, and the strategy. The final missing piece is you — the founding team.”

  **The Ask:** I’m asking for full commitment to join as co-founders of Project Flora.

  **Next Steps:**  
  1. Formally agree to partner.  
  2. Define roles, responsibilities, and equity.  
  3. Collaborate on technical spec and architectural decisions.  
  4. Begin MVP development in Q4 2025.  

  **Urgency:** The timing is perfect. The market is ready, the technology exists, and we have the skills.
