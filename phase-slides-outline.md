# Phase Slides Outline - Flora Pitch Deck

## PHASE 1: Prove Value with Annie (MVP)
**Goal**: Get Annie's nursery designing with Flora and validate business value ASAP

### Geographic Scope
- **Tampa Bay + Sarasota area only**
- Working GIS pipeline for this region
- Local parcel data, aerial imagery, soil data

### Plant Database Scope
- **~250 plants** - Florida native species for this region
- Focus on what Annie's nursery actually sells
- Enough variety to do real designs, not comprehensive

### Technology Constraints
- **Adobe Illustrator UXP Plugin** - NOT building web CAD from scratch
- Work inside Annie's existing workflow (Illustrator)
- Augment her current process, don't replace it

### Core Features (Minimum Viable)
1. **GIS Import Button** - Address â†’ parcel + aerial imagery in Illustrator
2. **Plant Picker Panel** - Browse/filter ~250 Florida natives
3. **Basic Layout Tools** - Grid placement, along-path, simple fills
4. **Plant Schedule Export** - One-click BOM with counts
5. **2.5D Preview** - Simple sprite-based walkthrough (optional wow factor)

### NPR Graphics Goal
- Basic sketch-style rendering working
- Sprites for major plant types (trees, shrubs, groundcover categories)
- Possibly AI-generated 3D models for key species
- "Artist sketch of the property" aesthetic in 2.5D

### Success Metric
- **Annie's staff using it for real client projects**
- User feedback loop established
- Clear understanding of which features provide most value
- Proven time savings vs. manual Illustrator workflow

## PHASE 2: Scale Features & Geography
**Goal**: Expand based on Phase 1 learnings

### What Expands
- More plant species based on demand
- Additional Florida regions (or other states)
- Advanced layout algorithms (Poisson-disk, growth simulation)
- Enhanced client-side features (swap species, favorites, advanced tools)
- Better 3D models and rendering

### What Gets Built
- Features Annie's team specifically requested
- Tools that showed measurable time savings
- Capabilities that unlock new business opportunities

---

## PHASE 3: Beyond Illustrator
**Goal**: Standalone web CAD platform

### New Capabilities
- Full web-based CAD tool (not Illustrator dependent)
- National/multi-region support
- Comprehensive plant database (thousands of species)
- Advanced ecological analysis
- Team collaboration features
- Full 3D terrain modeling

### Why Later
- Phase 1 proves business model with minimal risk
- We learn what actually matters before building from scratch
- Annie validates market demand and pricing
- Clearer feature priorities from real usage

---

## KEY MESSAGE FOR PITCH
**Phase 1 is about VALIDATION, not VISION**

- Start small and focused (Tampa/Sarasota, 250 plants, Annie's nursery)
- Prove value quickly (weeks, not months)
- Learn what features actually matter
- Use existing tools (Illustrator) before building new ones
- Establish customer feedback loop with real users
- De-risk the bigger vision with real-world validation

**The full vision is still the "operating system for sustainable landscape design" - but we're smart enough to validate it step-by-step rather than building everything at once.**
