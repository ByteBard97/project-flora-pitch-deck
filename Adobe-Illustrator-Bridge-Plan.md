# Plant-Aware Illustrator: Updated Architecture (Client-Side Focus)

**Legend (Core Logic Location):**

- **HTML/JS** \= UXP panel UI (HTML/CSS/JS inside Illustrator) - **PRIMARY for all computational work**
- **Django** \= minimal server API (read-only plant database, sync only)
- **C++** \= native Illustrator plug-in (only if we need pointer-down, buttery interaction)
- **Ext. Script** \= external Python CLI/notebook (GDAL, rasterio) run outside Illustrator
- **Babylon** \= browser viewer for 2.5D "cardboard cutout" walkthrough

**üéØ Revised Architecture Principles:**
- **Single-user focused** - No team collaboration complexity initially
- **Client-side computational geometry** - All layout algorithms in JavaScript
- **Minimal server dependencies** - Django provides read-only plant data only
- **Offline-capable** - Plugin works without internet after initial sync
- **Local state management** - Project settings and layouts stored in Illustrator documents

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Plant Database (read-only) | Central store of species, traits (spread, height, sun, water, native flag, cost, bloom) | **Django** | ‚Äî | High. Server provides read-only plant data for sync. |
| Plant Picker Panel | Browse/filter plants, insert into doc | **HTML/JS** | Django (sync only) | High. Panel uses cached plant data; calls `/plants/sync` periodically. |
| Symbol/Style Manager | Map plant ‚Üí Illustrator symbol(s), scale rules | **HTML/JS** | ‚Äî | High. All symbol/style logic client-side using cached metadata. |
| Favorites / Palettes | Save reusable plant sets | **HTML/JS** | ‚Äî | Med. Store in Illustrator document metadata or local storage. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Site Preprocessing (DEM, NAIP, parcel, contours) | Clip/warp to site; produce scaled background | **Ext. Script** | Django (job orchestration optional) | High. One-time per site. Outputs: scaled SVG/DXF \+ raster. |

# Event/Data Flows (Updated for Client-Side Architecture)

1. **Plugin Startup & Plant Sync**

   - HTML/JS: Check local plant cache ‚Üí if expired or requested: `GET /api/plants/sync?since=timestamp` ‚Üí Django returns updated plants ‚Üí cache locally ‚Üí ready for offline work.



2. **Place Along Path**

   - HTML/JS: read selected path ‚Üí calculate positions using JavaScript geometry (linear interpolation, spacing) ‚Üí place symbols directly ‚Üí store `plant_id` in Illustrator metadata.



3. **Mass Fill Area**

   - HTML/JS: read polygon ‚Üí run grid/hex/jitter algorithm in JavaScript ‚Üí calculate packed points locally ‚Üí place symbols ‚Üí store metadata.



4. **Spacing Check**

   - HTML/JS: gather all plant instances from document ‚Üí calculate distances using JavaScript ‚Üí identify violations ‚Üí highlight overlapping plants with visual feedback.



5. **Schedule Generation**

   - HTML/JS: count plants directly from document metadata ‚Üí format schedule using cached plant data (names, costs) ‚Üí generate CSV/SVG locally or save to file.



6. **Growth Preview**

   - HTML/JS: toggle ‚Üí draw transient circles per instance using cached `spread` values from plant data (no server call).



7. **Swap Species**

   - HTML/JS: select scope ‚Üí replace symbols and metadata directly in document ‚Üí update using cached plant data.

# When to add C++ (clear decision rule)

Add a tiny native tool **only** if you need:

- **Per-frame, pointer-down previews** (painting hedgerows/arrays at 60 fps), or
- A **true Illustrator Tool** (custom cursors, modifiers) beyond what a panel-based workflow can comfortably provide.

Since all computational work now happens client-side, C++ tools would preview and execute locally without server dependencies.

---

# Simplified Django API (Read-Only Focus)

**Essential Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/plants/` ‚Üí list `{id, name_common, name_botanical, traits, symbol_ref, spread_m, height_m, cost, svg_symbol, plan_color, plan_radius_m}`
- `GET /api/plants/sync?since=timestamp` ‚Üí optimized sync endpoint returning only updated plants since timestamp
- `GET /api/plants/{id}/` ‚Üí detailed plant data

**Optional Future Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/manifests/export` ‚Üí store layout manifest for sharing (optional)
- `GET /api/manifests/{id}/` ‚Üí retrieve shared manifest (optional)

**Removed Endpoints (Now Client-Side):**
- ~~`POST /layout/along_path`~~ ‚Üí JavaScript geometry
- ~~`POST /layout/fill`~~ ‚Üí JavaScript algorithms
- ~~`POST /check/spacing`~~ ‚Üí JavaScript distance calculations
- ~~`POST /schedule`~~ ‚Üí JavaScript document counting

## üéØ **Key Benefits of This Updated Architecture**

1. **Faster Performance** - No server round trips for computational geometry
2. **Offline Capable** - Plugin works without internet after initial plant sync
3. **Simpler Deployment** - Minimal server complexity, focus on data management
4. **Better UX** - Real-time feedback for all plant placement operations
5. **Single-User Optimized** - All complexity lives in user-facing applications
6. **Scalable** - Server focuses purely on plant data management and sync

This architecture maximizes JavaScript capabilities in the UXP plugin while keeping the Django backend minimal and focused on what it does best: managing and serving plant data.
