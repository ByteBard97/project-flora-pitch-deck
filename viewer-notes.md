## Slide 2: Problem
**Opening:** "The landscape design software ecosystem is broken, and it's broken in two very different ways."

**Professional Side:** Professionals are stuck with powerful but punishing tools. AutoCAD with Land F/X or Vectorworks Landmark are technically capable — but cost $1,500+/year, require extensive training, treat plants as generic objects, and force small firms into inefficient workarounds.

**The Franken-stack:** CAD for drafting, Illustrator for presentation, spreadsheets for takeoffs, and external websites for plant research. This workflow drains time and money while increasing the risk of error.

**Consumer Side:** Consumers and DIY designers rely on apps like iScape or SketchUp. Easy to pick up, but shallow — plants are decorative clip art with no ecological intelligence. Users quickly hit an "aesthetic ceiling."

**The Deeper Questions:** Tools can visualize a patio or bed, but can't answer: Will this survive in my soil? Will it support pollinators? Will it thrive in this climate? Many hack together designs in PowerPoint or even video games.

**Core Tension:** Tools are either overly complex and expensive, or overly simplistic and ecologically blind. Between those extremes lies a massive unmet need.

## Slide 3: Franken-Stack
**Framing:** "Let's look at how professionals actually get work done today. It's a mess — a Franken-stack of disconnected tools."

**Workflow Chaos:** AutoCAD for drafting, Illustrator for visuals, Excel for takeoffs, and even external sites for plant research. Every handoff is manual and error-prone.

**Hidden Costs:**
• Data risk: import/export corruption and cleanup.
• Time sink: manual takeoffs eat hours on razor-thin margins.
• Financial drain: $3,000+/year across subscriptions.
• Efficiency loss: countless hours wasted.

**Transition:** "This is the environment Flora is built to replace — one system instead of four."

## Slide 4: Opportunity
**Framing:** "These frustrations aren't just pain — they're a market signal."

**Market Size:** Global landscape design software market is ~$2.95B in 2024 and forecasted to reach $5.45B by 2030, growing at a healthy 10.8% CAGR.

**Foundation:** It's built on top of a massive $264.7B landscaping services industry. This is no niche; it's a core part of the economy.

**Opportunity:** No integrated solution exists. Every competitor is either too complex, too simple, or too fragmented. That leaves a wide-open gap for Flora to lead.
