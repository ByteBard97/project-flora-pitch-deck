Of course. You've done a fantastic job compiling an exhaustive catalog of geospatial data sources and potential architectures. To get you started this weekend, I've synthesized all of your research into a direct, actionable game plan.

This guide focuses on building your prototype for a couple of specific U.S. properties using the most direct, free, and high-quality data sources you identified. We'll use manual downloads for the demo to avoid the complexity of setting up API integrations right away.

## Your Weekend Prototype Game Plan

The strategy is simple:

1.  **Source Manually:** For your two demo parcels, we'll manually download the required data from free, public portals.
2.  **Use QGIS as Your Workbench:** **QGIS** is a free, powerful desktop GIS application. It will be our central tool for assembling, clipping, and reprojecting data before exporting it.
3.  **Target Two Outputs:** We'll follow two distinct recipes‚Äîone for a 2D SVG for Illustrator and one for a 3D web scene.

### Recipe 1: The 2D Illustrator Site Plan (SVG) üó∫Ô∏è

This recipe will give you a clean, layered, and perfectly scaled vector file ready for design work.

#### **Step 1: Get the Parcel Boundary (Your "Cookie Cutter")**

- **Source:** Local County GIS Portal.
- **Action:** Search for "[County Name] [State] GIS Data Download" or "Parcel Data". Find the property on their web map and look for a download option for a **Shapefile (.shp)**. This is the most accurate source for a specific property line.

#### **Step 2: Get High-Resolution Aerial Imagery (Your Base Layer)**

- **Source:** **USGS EarthExplorer**.
- **Action:**
  1.  Go to the EarthExplorer website and create a free account.
  2.  Use the map to define an area of interest around your parcel.
  3.  Under the "Data Sets" tab, navigate to "Aerial Imagery" and select **"NAIP Imagery"**.
  4.  Search and download the most recent, cloud-free image available for your area. It will likely be a **GeoTIFF (.tif)** file.

#### **Step 3: Get Context (Roads & Buildings)**

- **Source:** **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** via [GeoFabrik Downloads](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
- **Action:** Download the Shapefile data for your state. This will give you comprehensive data for roads, buildings, and other features. The files will be named something like `gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp` and `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.shp`.

#### **Step 4: Assemble and Export in QGIS üõ†Ô∏è**

This is where it all comes together.

1.  **Load Layers:** Open QGIS and drag-and-drop your parcel Shapefile, the NAIP GeoTIFF, and the OSM roads and buildings Shapefiles into the main window.
2.  **Set a Common CRS:** Your data will have different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS). To work at a local scale, it's best to reproject everything to a common projected system like **UTM**.
    - In the bottom-right of QGIS, click the current CRS (e.g., "EPSG:4326").
    - Select an appropriate UTM zone for your location (e.g., "NAD83 / UTM zone 17N" for Florida).
3.  **Clip to Your Parcel:**
    - Go to `Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip`. Use your parcel layer as the "Overlay Layer" to clip the roads and buildings layers.
    - Go to `Raster > Extraction > Clip Raster by Mask Layer`. Use your parcel layer to clip the NAIP imagery.
4.  **Style & Export:**
    - Turn off the original, un-clipped layers. Style the clipped layers with simple colors and line weights.
    - Go to `Project > New Print Layout`. Add a map to the layout, set the scale precisely (e.g., 1:500), and arrange it.
    - Go to `Layout > Export as SVG...`. **Make sure to check "Export map layers as SVG groups"** for easy editing in Illustrator.

**Result:** You'll have a perfectly scaled, layered SVG file with the imagery, parcel line, roads, and building footprints.

### Recipe 2: The 3D "Doom-like" Web Scene üåê

This recipe focuses on creating an interactive 3D view of the lot's terrain and structures in a web browser.

#### **Step 1: Get 3D Terrain (Elevation Data)**

- **Source:** **USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP)** via The National Map downloader.
- **Action:**
  1.  Go to the USGS National Map viewer.
  2.  Zoom to your parcel and select the "Download" tool.
  3.  In the download panel, check **"Elevation Products (3DEP)"** and select the highest resolution available (e.g., 1/3 arc-second or 1 meter).
  4.  Download the **GeoTIFF (.tif)** file. This is your Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

#### **Step 2: Get 3D Buildings (Footprints with Height)**

- **Source:** **Microsoft GlobalMLBuildingFootprints**.
- **Action:** Download the GeoJSON data for your region from their GitHub repository. This dataset is excellent because, unlike some others, it often contains estimated building heights, which are crucial for 3D extrusion.

#### **Step 3: Process & Host with Cesium ion (The Easy Button)**

As your research noted, raw DEMs are not web-ready. A service that tiles them is essential. Cesium ion's free community tier is perfect for this.

1.  **Sign up for a free Cesium ion account.**
2.  **Upload Assets:** In your ion account, upload your DEM GeoTIFF from Step 1 and the building GeoJSON from Step 2.
3.  **Tiling:** Cesium ion will automatically process your DEM into a **Quantized Mesh 3D Tileset** (Cesium World Terrain) and your buildings into a separate **3D Tileset**. This handles all the complex backend processing for you.

#### **Step 4: Display with CesiumJS (Simple Web Page)**

Create a simple `index.html` file and paste in the code below. You'll need to get your Asset IDs and your Access Token from your Cesium ion account.

    <script>
      // 1. Your Cesium ion access token
      Cesium.Ion.defaultAccessToken = "YOUR_CESIUM_ION_ACCESS_TOKEN";

      // 2. Initialize the Cesium Viewer
      const viewer = new Cesium.Viewer("cesiumContainer", {
        // Use your custom terrain asset from Cesium ion
        terrainProvider: Cesium.createWorldTerrain({
          requestWaterMask: true,
          requestVertexNormals: true,
        }),
      });

      // 3. Add your custom 3D building tileset
      const buildingTileset = viewer.scene.primitives.add(
        new Cesium.Cesium3DTileset({
          url: Cesium.IonResource.fromAssetId(YOUR_BUILDING_ASSET_ID), // <-- Paste your building asset ID here
        })
      );

      // Optional: Add the imagery from Step 2 of the 2D recipe as a base layer
      const imageryLayer = viewer.imageryLayers.addImageryProvider(
        new Cesium.IonImageryProvider({ assetId: YOUR_NAIP_IMAGERY_ASSET_ID }) // <-- Upload your NAIP GeoTIFF to Cesium ion and use its ID
      );

      // 4. Zoom to your asset
      viewer.zoomTo(buildingTileset);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Result:** A simple, shareable webpage that loads a true 3D view of your lot with accurate terrain elevation and extruded building models, which you can navigate freely.
