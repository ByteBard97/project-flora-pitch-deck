# 🌿 Project Flora: Pitch Deck (Co-Founder Edition)

---

## **Slide 1 — Title**

**Slide Content:**

- Logo (placeholder).
- “Project Flora: Intelligent Design for a Living World.”
- Subtitle: “Making landscape design easy, beautiful, and ecologically aware.”

**Notes:**
“We’re calling it Project Flora. The idea is simple: make landscape design software that’s easy to use, beautiful, and ecologically intelligent. Think of it as Illustrator meets native plants. We’re here because existing tools either ignore plants entirely or are so painful to use that most designers just avoid them.”

---

## **Slide 2 — The Big Opportunity**

**Slide Content:**

- Landscaping services = \$180B+ in the U.S. alone.
- Design software market ≈ \$3B today → \$5.6B by 2030.
- The Altium vs. OrCAD moment: outdated incumbents, room for disruption.

**Notes:**
“The landscaping services industry is enormous — over \$180B in the U.S. alone — but the software that supports it is a rounding error by comparison. That means two things: (1) the tools are outdated and underserved, and (2) if we build something people actually want to use, there’s room to grow fast. This feels like Altium vs. OrCAD — the right team shows up with a tool that’s easier and smarter, and they eat the market.”

---

## **Slide 3 — The Problem**

**Slide Content:**

- Professional tools: Expensive, clunky, plant-ignorant.
- Consumer apps: Pretty but dumb.
- Annie’s pain: everything in Illustrator, no intelligence.

**Notes:**
“Professional tools like AutoCAD and Vectorworks are powerful, but they ignore plants and ecology — and they’re brutally expensive and hard to learn. Consumer apps look nice but are basically just clip art. And right now, Annie has to use Illustrator, which means everything is manual — drawing, counting plants, no intelligence at all. That’s time lost and sales left on the table.”

## **Slide 4 — The Solution: Flora Platform**

**Slide Content:**
Core pillars:

1. Instant Site Setup.
2. Plant-Aware Design.
3. Beautiful & Easy UI.
4. One-Click Plant List.
5. Doom-Style Walkthrough.

**Notes:**
“Flora fixes this by being three things at once: easy to use, plant-aware, and beautiful. You type in an address and get a site base instantly. You drag and drop native plants that auto-filter to your region and spacing. You hit one button and get a branded plant list that can tie directly to a nursery or contractor. And when you want to wow a client, you can walk them through the space in a simple 3D view.”

---

## **Slide 5 — MVP Demo Flow**

**Slide Content:**

1. Address → instant site base.
2. Drag & drop plants (smart filters + spacing).
3. Generate PDF plant list.
4. Walkthrough mode.

**Notes:**
“Here’s the magic moment I want to demo: address in, site pops up. Drop some plants — the system knows how to space them and filter for sun/shade. Click one button and you’ve got a clean, professional plant list PDF. Then, as a cherry on top, you can hit ‘3D mode’ and walk around like Doom. That demo alone is enough to get investors or customers leaning forward.”

## **Slide 6 — Business Value Proposition**

**Slide Content:**

- Nurseries: drive plant sales.
- Designers/contractors: save hours.
- Homeowners: approachable.
- SaaS + partnerships = scalable revenue.

**Notes:**
“This isn’t just a pretty toy — it directly adds business value. For Annie, every design can instantly generate a sales-ready plant list. For contractors, it saves hours of manual takeoffs. For homeowners, it makes design approachable. And for us, it means recurring SaaS revenue plus partnerships with suppliers who want to plug into this pipeline.”

---

## **Slide 7 — Market Landscape**

**Slide Content:**

- Design software: \$3B today → \$5.6B by 2030.
- Landscaping services: \$180B U.S., \$330B global.
- 700k+ U.S. businesses, mostly small.

**Notes:**
“The software side of the industry is growing — from \~\$3B today to \$5–6B by 2030 — but it’s still dwarfed by the \$180B+ services market. That gap is our opportunity: tools that help designers and nurseries sell more plants and projects. There are over 700,000 landscaping businesses in the U.S., most of them small, which means they need something affordable and simple, not enterprise CAD.”

---

## **Slide 8 — Why Now**

**Slide Content:**

- Outdoor living boom.
- Sustainability regulations.
- Cloud + AI = small teams can build magic.

**Notes:**
“There are three big tailwinds: one, people are spending more than ever on outdoor living after COVID. Two, cities and states are pushing hard for sustainability, water conservation, and native plants. And three, modern web and AI tech makes it possible for a small team like us to build something fast that feels magical. The timing couldn’t be better.”

---

## **Slide 9 — Competitive Positioning**

**Slide Content:**

- 2×2 Matrix: Ease of Use vs. Ecological Intelligence.
- CAD incumbents = powerful but painful.
- Consumer apps = easy but dumb.
- Flora = easy + intelligent.

**Notes:**
“If you map the landscape: professional CAD is powerful but painful, consumer apps are easy but dumb. Nobody is delivering both ease of use and ecological intelligence. That’s the empty quadrant where we can stand alone, at least for the next few years.”

---

## **Slide 10 — Business Model**

**Slide Content:**

- Freemium tier for homeowners.
- Pro SaaS \$20–50/month.
- Affiliate/ads with suppliers.
- Future: full proposal generation.

**Notes:**
“Start simple: freemium tier for homeowners, pro tier around \$20–50/month for designers and contractors. From there, monetization expands into affiliate revenue — think Home Depot, local nurseries, or hardscape suppliers. In later versions, we can generate full proposals with costs, which is where contractors will gladly pay for automation.”

---

## **Slide 11 — Traction & MVP Plan**

**Slide Content:**

- Team can build demo in 3–6 months.
- Annie’s nursery = pilot.
- Immediate customer validation.

**Notes:**
“Our unfair advantage is that we can build a demo fast. With our combined skills in GIS, CAD, and ag-tech, plus Annie’s nursery as a live test case, we don’t need to guess at what users want — we can validate in real time. The plan is to hack together a demo in 3–6 months of weekends, then use that to show investors and partners what’s possible.”

---

## **Slide 12 — Team**

**Slide Content:**

- Annie: nursery owner + designer.
- You: CAD/GIS backbone + strategy.
- Jake: engineering velocity.
- Right people, right time.

**Notes:**
“This is the right team at the right time. Annie brings domain expertise, customer access, and design polish. Jake brings engineering depth and velocity. I bring CAD/GIS know-how and product strategy. Together, we cover the three legs that matter: technology, domain, and aesthetics. That’s what makes this believable.”

---

## **Slide 13 — Ask (for Co-Founders)**

**Slide Content:**

- Commit to building MVP together.
- Annie: design + customer validation.
- Jake: engineering.
- You: CAD/GIS + strategy.

**Notes:**
“What I’m asking tonight is simple: let’s commit to building the MVP together. Annie, you’d shape the aesthetics and provide nursery validation. Jake, you’d drive the engineering. I’ll handle GIS, CAD, and product scaffolding. Together, we can get to a demo that shows the magic — and from there, the sky’s the limit.”
